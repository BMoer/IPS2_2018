abstract = {One of the most significant directions in the development of computer science and information and communication technologies is represented by Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) which are systems of collaborating computational entities which are in intensive connection with the surrounding physical world and its on-going processes, providing and using, at the same time, data-accessing and data-processing services available on the internet. Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs), relying on the newest and foreseeable further developments of computer science, information and communication technologies on the one hand, and of manufacturing science and technology, on the other, may lead to the 4th Industrial Revolution, frequently noted as Industry 4.0. The key-note will underline that there are significant roots generally – and particularly in the CIRP community – which point towards CPPSs. Expectations and the related new R{\&}D challenges will be outlined.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency is one of the key drivers for sustainability. Within manufacturing environments, energy efficiency importance has grown, and it is now considered among other decision-making factors such as productivity, cost and flexibility. However, in most cases the energy consumption of the various components of the manufacturing systems, such as machine tools, are considered using average energy consumption models for the needs of discrete event simulation. The paper presents an overview of energy efficiency approaches, focusing in both production and machine tool level and how these two can be integrated together. Furthermore, the main challenges towards energy efficient manufacturing are discussed identifying the major barriers from both technology and cultural point of view.},

abstract = {Measuring energy efficiency performance of equipments, processes and factories is the first step to effective energy management in production. Thus, enabled energy-related information allows the assessment of the progress of manufacturing companies toward their energy efficiency goals. In that respect, the study addresses this challenge where current industrial approaches lack the means and appropriate performance indicators to compare energy-use profiles of machines and processes, and for the comparison of their energy efficiency performance to that of competitors'. Focusing on this challenge, the main objective of the paper is to present a method which supports manufacturing companies in the development of energy-based performance indicators. For this purpose, we provide a 7-step method to develop production-tailored and energy-related key performance indicators (e-KPIs). These indicators allow the interpretation of cause-effect relationships and therefore support companies in their operative decision-making process. Consequently, the proposed method supports the identification of weaknesses and areas for energy efficiency improvements related to the management of production and operations. The study therefore aims to strengthen the theoretical base necessary to support energy-based decision making in manufacturing industries.},

abstract = {During the past twenty years, developments in the manufacturing world have revolutionized many aspects of the production process. The introduction of computer technology and automation have had a particularly great impact on manufacturing with a variety of consequences. One consequence is that manufacturing issues cannot be addressed as isolated problems; they require "systems thinking." Thus study and understanding of the behavior of manufacturing systems is an emerging field with a strong interdisciplinary character and increasing importance from an academic and industrial point of view. The purpose of this book is to provide some fundamental methods and tools which can be useful in addressing design and operation issues in manufacturing systems. It is intended as an advanced undergraduate/graduate text for students taking courses in manufacturing and manufacturing systems. The problem solution manual and laboratory handouts are available from the author. In addition, this book can be used by academicians and practitioners. It can also be used by practicing manufacturing engineers to gain insight, techniques and methods related to practical issues of manufacturing systems.},

abstract = {For governments and for manufacturing companies, global warming, rising energy prices, and customers' increasing ecological awareness have pushed energy efficient manufacturing to the top of the agenda. Governments and companies are both striving to identify the most effective measures to increase energy efficiency in manufacturing processes. Based on results of a recent EU-funded roadmapping project, this paper highlights the needs of industrial companies for integrating energy efficiency performance in production management. First, it analyses concepts and tools for measurement, control and improvement of energy efficiency in production management proposed in literature. Second, the paper outlines that ICT tools and standardization are important enablers for energy efficient manufacturing. Third, industrial needs in these areas are presented based on expert interviews. The industrial needs thus identified are contrasted with concepts proposed in literature to point out the implementation gaps between practice and theory. The paper demonstrates that there exists a gap between the solutions available and the actual implementation in industrial companies. It concludes by deriving requirements for energy management in production that future collaborative research projects should address.},

abstract = {Machining processes cause measurable impacts on environment due to substantial amounts of energy consumption. Enhancing energy efficiency of machine tools can significantly improve the environmental performance of machining systems. For this reason, an on-line energy efficiency monitoring system is necessary. Most conventional approaches monitored the energy efficiency by directly measuring cutting power with torque sensors or dynamometers. In contrast, we propose a new on-line approach without using any torque sensor or dynamometer which leads to a decreased implementation cost. The energy efficiency monitoring model of this approach is constructed based on an energy consumption model of machine tool. Then the entire machine-tool energy consumption can be divided into two parts, i.e. constant energy consumption and variable energy consumption. The former is measured in advance and stored in database, and the latter is derived from cutting power that can be estimated on-line according to power balance equation and additional load loss function. The additional load loss function can be identified off-line through input power and cutting power of the machine-tool spindle. Several experiments are performed on a CNC machine tool CJK6136 and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Energy has recently become one of the key aspects that companies should improve and keep monitoring, due to the related economic costs and the significant environmental impacts, to which today's society is paying more and more attention. An Energy Management System could offer many advantages, such as energy consumption and cost reductions, improvement of corporate image, environmental impact reduction. Organizations have therefore developed more comprehensive approaches to Energy Management, aiming at reducing energy waste, but also at managing energy use by applying specific focused programs. Maturity Models are tools used to assess the level of maturity of an organization, providing a systematic framework for carrying out benchmarking and performance improvement. With regards to Energy Management, existing tools are still not well-structured and do not allow a deep analysis of the level of maturity of an organization and of how this maturity develops along with its dimensions. In this article the described general Maturity Model tools are implemented, providing an innovative method in order to apply those concepts to the Energy Management field, aiming at bridging the aforementioned gaps. A user-friendly tool, focused on the company and its organization, is provided to allow practitioners to easily and autonomously assess their company's maturity level, drawing a first growth plan draft. This method represents a new way to lead the organization to a proper management of its energy needs, and is alternative or complementary to the certification of the Energy Management System of the organization, being consistent with the ISO 50001 standard.},
