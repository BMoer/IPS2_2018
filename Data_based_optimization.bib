Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs), relying on the newest and foreseeable further developments of computer science, information and communication technologies on the one hand, and of manufacturing science and technology, on the other, may lead to the 4th Industrial Revolution, frequently noted as Industry 4.0. The key-note will underline that there are significant roots generally – and particularly in the CIRP community – which point towards CPPSs.

abstract = {Energy efficiency is one of the key drivers for sustainability. Within manufacturing environments, energy efficiency importance has grown, and it is now considered among other decision-making factors such as productivity, cost and flexibility. However, in most cases the energy consumption of the various components of the manufacturing systems, such as machine tools, are considered using average energy consumption models for the needs of discrete event simulation. The paper presents an overview of energy efficiency approaches, focusing in both production and machine tool level and how these two can be integrated together. Furthermore, the main challenges towards energy efficient manufacturing are discussed identifying the major barriers from both technology and cultural point of view.},

abstract = {Measuring energy efficiency performance of equipments, processes and factories is the first step to effective energy management in production. Thus, enabled energy-related information allows the assessment of the progress of manufacturing companies toward their energy efficiency goals. In that respect, the study addresses this challenge where current industrial approaches lack the means and appropriate performance indicators to compare energy-use profiles of machines and processes, and for the comparison of their energy efficiency performance to that of competitors'. Focusing on this challenge, the main objective of the paper is to present a method which supports manufacturing companies in the development of energy-based performance indicators. For this purpose, we provide a 7-step method to develop production-tailored and energy-related key performance indicators (e-KPIs). These indicators allow the interpretation of cause-effect relationships and therefore support companies in their operative decision-making process. Consequently, the proposed method supports the identification of weaknesses and areas for energy efficiency improvements related to the management of production and operations. The study therefore aims to strengthen the theoretical base necessary to support energy-based decision making in manufacturing industries.},

Thus study and understanding of the behavior of manufacturing systems is an emerging field with a strong interdisciplinary character and increasing importance from an academic and industrial point of view. The purpose of this book is to provide some fundamental methods and tools which can be useful in addressing design and operation issues in manufacturing systems. It is intended as an advanced undergraduate/graduate text for students taking courses in manufacturing and manufacturing systems. The problem solution manual and laboratory handouts are available from the author. In addition, this book can be used by academicians and practitioners.

First, it analyses concepts and tools for measurement, control and improvement of energy efficiency in production management proposed in literature. Second, the paper outlines that ICT tools and standardization are important enablers for energy efficient manufacturing.

abstract = {Machining processes cause measurable impacts on environment due to substantial amounts of energy consumption. Enhancing energy efficiency of machine tools can significantly improve the environmental performance of machining systems. For this reason, an on-line energy efficiency monitoring system is necessary. Most conventional approaches monitored the energy efficiency by directly measuring cutting power with torque sensors or dynamometers. In contrast, we propose a new on-line approach without using any torque sensor or dynamometer which leads to a decreased implementation cost. The energy efficiency monitoring model of this approach is constructed based on an energy consumption model of machine tool. Then the entire machine-tool energy consumption can be divided into two parts, i.e. constant energy consumption and variable energy consumption. The former is measured in advance and stored in database, and the latter is derived from cutting power that can be estimated on-line according to power balance equation and additional load loss function. The additional load loss function can be identified off-line through input power and cutting power of the machine-tool spindle. Several experiments are performed on a CNC machine tool CJK6136 and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

An Energy Management System could offer many advantages, such as energy consumption and cost reductions, improvement of corporate image, environmental impact reduction. Organizations have therefore developed more comprehensive approaches to Energy Management, aiming at reducing energy waste, but also at managing energy use by applying specific focused programs. Maturity Models are tools used to assess the level of maturity of an organization, providing a systematic framework for carrying out benchmarking and performance improvement. With regards to Energy Management, existing tools are still not well-structured and do not allow a deep analysis of the level of maturity of an organization and of how this maturity develops along with its dimensions. In this article the described general Maturity Model tools are implemented, providing an innovative method in order to apply those concepts to the Energy Management field, aiming at bridging the aforementioned gaps. A user-friendly tool, focused on the company and its organization, is provided to allow practitioners to easily and autonomously assess their company's maturity level, drawing a first growth plan draft. This method represents a new way to lead the organization to a proper management of its energy needs, and is alternative or complementary to the certification of the Energy Management System of the organization, being consistent with the ISO 50001 standard.},

The chiller plant operation is not optimal in most of the existing buildings because the chiller plant is either operated at design condition irrespective of the cooling load or optimized locally due to lack of overall chiller plant behavior. In this study, an overall energy model of chiller plant is developed to capture the thermal behavior of all systems and their in-teractions including the power consumption. An energy optimization methodology is proposed to derive optimized operation decisions for chiller plant at regular intervals based on building thermal load and weather condition. The benefits of proposed energy optimization methodology are examined using case study problems covering different chiller plant configurations. The case studies result confirmed the energy savings achieved through optimized operations is up to 40{\%} for moderate size chiller plant and around 20{\%} for small chiller plant which consequently reduces the energy cost and greenhouse gas emissions.},

abstract = {Air conditioning is essential for maintaining thermal comfort in indoor environments, particularly for hot and humid climates. Today, air conditioning, comprising cooling and dehumidification, has become a necessity in commercial and residential buildings and industrial processes. It accounts for a major share of the energy consumption of a building or facility. In tropical climates, the energy consumed by heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) can exceed 50{\%} of the total energy consumption of a building. This significant figure is primarily due to the heavy duty placed on cooling technologies to remove both sensible and latent heat loads. Therefore, there is tremendous potential to improve the overall efficiency of the air-conditioning systems in buildings. Based on today's practical technology for cooling, the major components of a chiller plant are (1) compressors, (2) cooling towers, (3) pumps (chilled and cooling water) and (4) fans in air handling units. They all consume mainly electricity to operate. When specifying the kW/Rton of a plant, there are two levels of monitoring cooling efficiency: (1) at the efficiency of the chiller machines or the compressors which consume a major amount of electricity; and (2) at the overall efficiency of cooling plants which include the cooling towers, pumps for moving coolant (chilled and cooling water) to all air-handling units. Pragmatically, a holistic approach is necessary towards achieving a low energy input per cooling achieved such as 0.6kW/Rton cooling or lower by considering all aspects of the cooling plant. In this paper, we present a review of recent innovative cooling technology and strategies that could potentially lower the kW/Rton of cooling systems – from the existing mean of 0.9kW/Rton towards 0.6kW/Rton or lower. The paper, broadly divided into three key sections (see Fig. 2), begins with a review of the recent novel devices that enhances the energy efficiency of cooling systems at the component level. This is followed by a review of innovative cooling systems designs that reduces energy use for air conditioning. Lastly, the paper presents recent developments in intelligent air-control strategies and smart chiller sequencing methodologies that reduce the primary energy utilization for cooling. The energy efficient cooling technology, innovative systems designs, and intelligent control strategies described in the paper have been recently researched or are on-going studies. Several have been implemented on a larger scale and, therefore, are examples of practical solutions that can be readily applied to suit specific needs.},

abstract = {In HVAC plants of medium–high cooling capacity, multiple-chiller systems are often employed. In such systems, chillers are independent of each other to provide standby capacity, operational flexibility, and less disruption maintenance. However, the problem of efficiently managing multiple-chiller systems is complex in many respects. In particular, the electrical energy consumption in the chiller plant markedly increases if the chillers are managed improperly, therefore significant energy savings can be achieved by optimizing the chiller operations of HVAC systems. In this paper an unified method for Multi-Chiller Management optimization is presented, that deals simultaneously with the Optimal Chiller Loading and Optimal Chiller Sequencing problems. The main objective is that of reducing both power consumption and operative costs. The approach is based on a cooling load estimation algorithm, and the optimization step is performed by means of a multi-phase genetic algorithm, that provides an efficient and suitable approach to solve this kind of complex multi-objective optimization problem. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by resorting to a dynamic simulation environment developed in Matlab/SimulinkTM, where the plant dynamics are accurately described.

EPSO is an efficient tool for solving DOCL problem. a b s t r a c t One of the most important issues in multi-chiller systems (MCSs) is more energy saving by the mini-mization of the total electrical power consumption (TEPC) of the chillers. In this paper, daily optimal chiller loading (DOCL) problem is introduced where a 24-h cooling load profile should be satisfied by a number of chillers so that the total power consumption of the chillers during 24-h is minimized. Since in DOCL problem, the number of the decision variables which should be tuned simultaneously is 24 times greater than OCL, DOCL is a more complex optimization technique than OCL. Particle swarm optimization is an efficient stochastic metaheuristic technique which has shown a promising performance in solving the OCL optimization problem. As a result, in this paper, for efficiently solving the DOCL problem, two variants of PSO named elitism-based PSO (EPSO) and multi-agent PSO (MA-PSO) are developed. Compared with the original PSO, the proposed MA-PSO and EPSO find better results.},

We obtained 12.68{\%} power saving on 55{\%} chiller partial load rate (PLR) and 17.63{\%} power saving on 70{\%} PLR after analysis and comparison with the linear regression (LR) and equal loading distribution (ELD) methods. Therefore, the NNPSO method solved the problem of fast convergence on optimal chiller load (OCL), and produced highly accurate results within a short timeframe. The proposed approaches can be applied to air-conditioning systems and other related optimization problems.},

Core to an accurate analysis of a chilled water plant is the component models used for the chilled water plant equipment. This paper documents techniques to create calibrated simulation models of electric chillers from manufacturers' and short-term monitored data The authors present two techniques: (1) standard linear regression for well-formed data sets and (2) a reference-curve method that can be used with small or limited data sets through the application of a library of well-formed regression models. These techniques, incorporated into a publicly available automated tool, have been applied to hundreds of chillers. This paper describes the authors' experience with these techniques and provides insight into the lessons learned in their application.},
